# Stryker Cleanup - Commit Message

Remove .stryker-tmp/ from git tracking

## What was done:
- Removed `.stryker-tmp/` directory from git tracking using `git rm -r --cached .stryker-tmp`
- This directory contains temporary build artifacts from Stryker mutation testing
- Already excluded in `.gitignore` but was previously committed

## Why:
`.stryker-tmp/` should NEVER be committed because:
1. Contains temporary, auto-generated files
2. Large in size (100s of MB)
3. Environment-specific (won't work on other machines)
4. Adds unnecessary bloat to repository
5. Regenerated fresh on each Stryker run

## Best Practice:
Only commit Stryker configuration files:
- ✅ stryker.conf.json
- ✅ stryker-*.conf.json
- ❌ .stryker-tmp/ (temporary artifacts)
- ❌ stryker.log (log files)
- ❌ reports/mutation/ (HTML/JSON reports)

## Verification:
The `.gitignore` already correctly excludes:
```
.stryker-tmp/
reports/mutation/
stryker.log
```

## Impact:
- Removes ~150+ temporary files from git tracking
- Reduces repository size
- Prevents merge conflicts on temporary files
- Follows Stryker best practices

## Next Steps:
When you commit this change:
```bash
git commit -m "chore: remove .stryker-tmp from git tracking"
```

The `.stryker-tmp/` directory will:
- No longer be tracked by git
- Still exist locally (if it exists)
- Be automatically ignored in future commits
- Be regenerated when running `npm run test:mutation`
