He is both an earnest scholar and a compulsive storyteller, collecting 'true versions' of events but telling everyone different ones.",
      "personality": "Witty, sarcastic, and morally ambiguous. Wayne is known for his quick thinking and silver tongue. A cunning wizard with a penchant for deception and a mysterious past, he seeks knowledge at any cost, often bending the truth to serve his purposes.",

Though hunger sometimes drove him to theft, he never lost his pride or abandoned hope.",
